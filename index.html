             <p>
                It is simply Im Duha, 28 years old.<br>
                really I  dont like talke alot, 
                I prefer to simplify evre things. do you know why because we dont have alot of time
                we must take a chances to do all things we love it.<br>
               
                <br>NOW I will tell you what I love and what I dont<br>
               
                <br>The first of all I am in love with spaghetti but I dont like food in general.
                I like Puzzles, its make you relax and you have to think deeply to solve it.
               
                <br>I've an eye for detail and identifying problems and seek to find solutions, really I like puzzles.
                <br>
                <br>Belive me its not a big problem and you have to be patient, and but your eyes on details that's it. 
               
               <br> And the most important thing is I explored the coding is my passion. It is really like puzzle

        Education 
    </h3>
             <p>
        When coding is your passion, then you are a real software developer. It is a matter of learning more and more .
        You have not to stop that. You are in a game and when you stop running and learning you are kicked out.
        
        but I  am Electrical engineer. And I decided to change my career path to be a software developer.
